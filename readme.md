I was unable to access the mobile version of the site so reading .md files on the site was a misery on my 9 inch HD tablet. Very simple CSS at the moment to do the job I need right now which exclusively works on pages for `.md` files, this is for use with the stylish add on but I'm sure it can be put on any CSS overloader

### Things to improve:
- Text may still be too small for some at current level, or it may be too narrow
- No sideways scrolling required at any reasonable zoom level
- Replace fixed pixel values with something more flexible
- Multiple branches to suit various screen widths and resolutions
- More clearly specify the code that is being overwritten

_This was designed for a Nook HD+ (9 inches, 1920x1280) to be able to read some eBooks stored on Github in markdown, so choices are mostly being made to fit that consideration_
