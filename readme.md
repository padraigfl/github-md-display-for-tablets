I was unable to access the mobile version of the site so reading .md files on the site was a misery on my 9 inch HD tablet. Very simple CSS at the moment to do the job I need right now which exclusively works on pages for .md files, but I'm putting it up onto github if anyone wants to provide recommendations.

### Things to improve:
- Text may still be too small for some at current level, or it may be too narrow
- No sideways scrolling required at any reasonable zoom level
- Replace fixed pixel values with something more flexible
